# Set Up Testing 
[Commit](https://github.com/vidaaudrey/fedulab/commit/030889aa5d839026bd9f270cf7f46347a4f97a80)

Follow the Create React App guide for [Writing Tests](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests) to understand some basic setups. 

It's useful to go through both [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) doc if you want to get an indepth understanding of FE testing.

To make it quick to write tests, we've added a few globals at `setupJestGlobals.js` so you don't have to require those packages in every file.
